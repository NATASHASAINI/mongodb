        "Data Scientist Assignment\n",
        "****\n",
        "\n",
        "As a Data Scientist, you are at the core of the RAG bot's \"intelligence.\" You will be responsible for defining how the bot understands questions, retrieves information, and how the LLM ultimately uses that information to generate answers. Your focus will be on the agent's logic and the data pipeline.\n",
        "Phase 1: Preparation\n",
        "Your primary goal is to research, understand, and propose an architecture for the RAG agent, and a high-level workflow for its data.\n",
        "Actions:\n",
        "Deep Dive into RAG:\n",
        "Review the the provided MongoDB workshop notebook: https://github.com/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/ai-rag-lab.ipynb\n",
        "Understand each step: chunking, embedding, ingestion, vector search, RAG, and memory. Pay close attention to the \"from scratch\" approach.\n",
        "Research different embedding models (e.g., Sentence Transformers, OpenAI Embeddings, Cohere Embeddings, models from Hugging Face). Think through their strengths, weaknesses, and how they are typically used.\n",
        "Research vector databases/stores (e.g., Faiss for local prototyping, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and specifically MongoDB Atlas Vector Search as it aligns with the workshop's context).\n",
        "Familiarize yourself with basic concepts of LLMs and how they consume context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Architecture & Workflow Diagram:\n",
        "Based on your research and the workshop, design a conceptual architecture diagram for the RAG agent. This should illustrate the major components and how they interact.\n",
        "Create a workflow diagram showing the flow of data when a user asks a question to the Discord bot, through your RAG system, and back to the user.\n",
        "Consider:\n",
        "Where will the knowledge base reside?\n",
        "How will documents be chunked and embedded?\n",
        "Where will embeddings be stored?\n",
        "How will a user query be embedded and used for search?\n",
        "How will retrieved context be passed to an LLM?\n",
        "Which LLM will you propose (e.g., a free/open-source option for a PoC like ollama with a local model, or a cloud API like Gemini, OpenAI if you get access)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Office Hours (optional):\n",
        "Use Office Hours to help with roadblocks rather than as a gatekeeper holding you back. This way you can start developing your code to make progress and no longer wait for Office hours.\n",
        "Some things to think about:\n",
        "Your proposed RAG agent architecture diagram.\n",
        "Your RAG workflow diagram.\n",
        "Your rationale for choosing specific embedding models, vector store approaches, and LLM providers.\n",
        "Any challenges or open questions you've identified (e.g., how to handle large documents, real-time updates to the knowledge base, cost implications of LLMs).\n",
        "How you plan to collaborate with the Backend Engineers on API design for your RAG components.\n",
        "🏆Phase 2: Development\n",
        "Can start development even if not attend Office hours. Start focusing on implementing the core RAG logic.\n",
        "Actions:\n",
        "Data Ingestion Pipeline:\n",
        "Implement the process of chunking your knowledge base documents.\n",
        "Generate embeddings for each chunk.\n",
        "Ingest these embeddings into your chosen vector store (e.g., a simple in-memory list for initial prototyping, a local vector store like FAISS, or integrate with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search)\n",
        ".\n",
        "Retrieval Logic:\n",
        "Implement the logic to convert an incoming user query into an embedding.\n",
        "Perform a vector search against your stored embeddings to retrieve the most relevant chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Augmentation & Generation (RAG Chain):\n",
        "Construct the prompt for the LLM by combining the user's original query and the retrieved context.\n",
        "Make an API call to the chosen LLM to generate the final answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Collaborate with Backend Engineers (Time Permitting):\n",
        "If time allows: Work closely with the Backend Engineers to define the API endpoints your RAG components will expose (e.g., an endpoint to receive a query and return an answer, or an endpoint for document ingestion).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Agent Evaluation (Time Permitting):\n",
        "If time allows, research and implement basic metrics for evaluating your RAG system's performance. Consider:\n",
        "Relevance/Precision: How often are the retrieved chunks actually relevant to the query?\n",
        "Faithfulness: Does the generated answer only use information from the retrieved context, or does it hallucinate?\n",
        "Answer Correctness: Is the final answer factually accurate based on the knowledge base?\n",
        "You might collect a small set of sample questions and their expected answers from your knowledge base to test against.\n",
        "Remember to start simple and iterate. Focus on getting a basic end-to-end flow working before optimizing or adding complex features.\n"

            "Discord Q&A Chatbot: Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines expertise from various domains such as statistics, computer science, machine learning, and domain-specific knowledge to analyze and interpret complex data sets.\n",
            "\n",
            "In simpler terms, data science involves collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can be used to make informed decisions and predictions. Data scientists use tools like programming languages (e.g., Python, R), statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization to derive valuable information from data.\n",

Feel free to ask about any data science-related term, tool, algorithm, or concept, and I'll do my best to provide a clear explanation for you.\n",
            "You: What is difference between ipv4 and ipv6\n",
            "Discord Q&A Chatbot: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) are two different versions of the Internet Protocol that are used to identify and locate devices on a network. Here are the main differences between IPv4 and IPv6:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Address Length**:\n",
            "   - IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.\n",
            "   - IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, providing a significantly larger address space with approximately 340 undecillion unique addresses.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Address Notation**:\n",
            "   - IPv4 addresses are typically expressed in decimal format separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).\n",
            "   - IPv6 addresses are expressed in hexadecimal format separated by colons and may contain groups of zeros compressed (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Address Configuration**:\n",
            "   - IPv4 addresses are often assigned statically or dynamically using methods like DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).\n",
            "   - IPv6 addresses can be assigned through stateless address autoconfiguration or DHCPv6, allowing devices to configure their own addresses.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Header Size**:\n",
            "   - IPv4 headers are 20 bytes in size and may include options for features like fragmentation and quality of service.\n",
            "   - IPv6 headers are streamlined to 40 bytes and have a more efficient design, reducing the need for extra processing by routers.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Security and Quality of Service**:\n",
            "   - IPv6 includes built-in support for security features like IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) and offers improved quality of service mechanisms compared to IPv4.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Migration and Adoption**:\n",
            "   - Due to the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses, the transition to IPv6 has been ongoing to accommodate the growing number of devices connecting to the Internet.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, IPv6 was developed to address the limitations of IPv4, particularly in terms of address space, security, and efficiency. While IPv4 is still widely used, the adoption of IPv6 is increasing to support the expanding demands of the Internet and ensure continued connectivity for all devices.\n"
